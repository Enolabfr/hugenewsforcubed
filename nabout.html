    <meta property="og:description" content="Hey everyone,
    
    I must inform you that we have encountered some trouble with Google Play, 
    as the update faced rejection in two consecutive reviews. 
    I am currently awaiting the outcome of the third review.
    
    In a positive development, Apple has approved the update for the App Store.
    
    While an early December release may be ambitious, 
    I can confidently state that the update is imminent.
    
    Stay tuned!
