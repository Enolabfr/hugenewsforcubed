    <meta property="og:description" content="Hey everyone,

    I'm pleased to report that all levels and major bug fixing for the 2.2 update are successfully completed, marking the final stages before release. However, I must inform you that we have encountered a hurdle with Google Play, as the update faced rejection in two consecutive reviews. We are currently awaiting the outcome of the third review.

    In a positive development, Apple has approved the update for the App Store.

    Ensuring a simultaneous release on App Store, Google Play, and Steam presents a challenge due to varying review times. While a November release may be ambitious, I can confidently state that the update is imminent. Your patience during this process is greatly appreciated.

    Stay tuned, and thank you for your patience
